# NoSQL-crud-update

Practicing updating using "put" , in this exercise we were using the route-parameter called "kids" and in ThunderClient in body , i entered the following key/value pair.
{ "name": "ScyFi" } . So once the route parameter was found "Kids" then it updated/replaced with ScyFi. \*\*\*Normally I will use a unique id to ensure the correct document is update, this was for practice/homework purposes.
